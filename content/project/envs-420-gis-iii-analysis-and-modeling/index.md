summary: This course provided me an in-depth examination of spatial data
  formats, spatial data analysis, and geoprocessing using ArcGIS and
  ModelBuilder. The primary work assessed human and environmental problems using
  GIS to explain and predict based on location, terrain, and human-environment
  interactions.

*Assess human and environmental issues/problems using GIS*\
*Analyze space, place, landscape, location, and human-environment interactions for the purposes of explanation and prediction using GIS*\
*Analyze and communicate ideas effectively in oral, written, and visual forms*
