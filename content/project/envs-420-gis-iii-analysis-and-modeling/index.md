This course provided me an in-depth examination of spatial data formats, spatial data analysis, and geoprocessing. My course objectives were:

*Assess human and environmental issues/problems using GIS*\
*Analyze space, place, landscape, location, and human-environment interactions for the purposes of explanation and prediction using GIS*\
*Analyze and communicate ideas effectively in oral, written, and visual forms*
