summary: This course covered the theory of remote sensing, platforms, and image
  analysis techniques in ENVI including classification, spectral analysis,
  change detection, PCA, and image segmentation using Orfeo and R. We also
  analyzed LIDAR using USGS FUSION and sUAS structure-from-motion data using
  Agisoft Photoscan.

This course by Dr. David Wallin covered the theory of EM radiation, examinations of modern remote sensing platforms and products including satellite- and airborne sensors, and the application of remote sensing techniques to environmental questions. Techniques learned for analyzing remotely sensed imagery include classification, spectral analysis, change detection, principle components analysis (PCA), and image segmentation. We also covered topics on LIDAR, sUAS, thermal radiation, and assessing interpretation accuracy.

This course also required in depth writing in the form of a report for each module. My reports containing sample work can be found below:
