This lesson was more a cumulative application of the skills we developed in this course.

### GIS Modeling of Climate Change Impacts on *Q. garryana* (a.k.a Oregon White Oak Garry Oak)

> * Analyze potential future climate change impacts on forests in western North America
>
>   Develop a GIS-based model to quantify projected shifts in the range of Q. garryana under various climate change scenarios for the late 21st century
>
>   Test model and format it so that it will be easy for your coworkers to re-use it with other projections of future climate conditions
