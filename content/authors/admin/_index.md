I started my career in the United States Marine Corps as a Topographic Intelligence Specialist (MOS 0261) where I primarily completed tasks related to geospatial intelligence, terrain analysis, and geodetic surveying. Since then I've worked to become an environmental scientist and GIS professional. My interests include serving the public, statistics, python, automation, data visualization, and web maps.
