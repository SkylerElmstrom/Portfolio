I started my career in the United States Marine Corps where I specialized in geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), terrain analysis, and geodetic surveying. After my service in the military, I studied environmental science, GIS, statistics, and data science. My skills continue to take me across disciplines where my knowledge and experience are broadly applicable. I believe leadership should happen at all levels, be transparent, foster innovation, and support the equitable advancement of those around you.

Feel free to contact me â€“ our paths are all difficult and unique.
